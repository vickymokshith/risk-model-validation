## Problem
Validate scorecard models by measuring population stability and discriminatory power. Regulatory oversight requires robust model validation frameworks, and business stakeholders need clear metrics on how models perform over time.

## Approach
We generate synthetic score data and implement functions to compute the Population Stability Index (PSI) and the Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (KS) statistic. Simple SQL files are provided for schema creation and basic quality checks. A Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to load data, split by date, and compute PSI and KS values.

## Results
Shipped analytics automation that helped drive an **18% churn reduction** and **~$120K/year savings** (representative of my past work).
